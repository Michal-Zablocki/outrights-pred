    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular bets offered by bookmakers are wagered on the outcome of single games.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex bets (e.g. parlays) are characterised by a significantly higher spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bookmakers are generally pretty good at estimating the odds and so it's difficult to be profitable, even theoretically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, there are also issues of taxation and the pattern of restricting bettors who seem to be profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, contrary to what would seem to be the case, I have justification to believe the following two theses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) There exist models which can predict the outcomes of games more accurately than what the implied odds are.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Bookmakers are bad at predicting the outright outcomes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the strategy I have come up with is to build on the outrights according to external models - and hope for the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "More seriously, there are 2 kinds of errors that the bookmaker can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me illustrate it with a simplified example.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a football (soccer) team who has 2 games in the season left to play. They'll become a champion only if they win both of these games.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bookmaker offers odds 2.5 for the team to win the first game and 2.0 to win the second game, meaning 40% and 50% respectively. Let's assume these are independent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bookmaker also offers 6.0 odds for the team to be the champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first kind of error that might have happened is that the bookmaker estimated the strength of the team of its opponents inaccurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the team is signifantly stronger and the actual probabilities are 50% and 60% instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second kind of error, which is quite clear, is that the bookmaker's outright odds are better than the odds that would be implied from their own predictions on the outcomes of single games.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the odds are 2.5 and 2.0 respectively, the implied odds on the team to become the champion should be 5.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything less than that means a higher spread for the bookmarker, whereas odds better than that allow the punter to hedge profitably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a model to predict the outcomes of all games in the season allows one to potentially exploit the second error."

    "## 2. How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The whole process relies on an external model(s) and a number of **sketchy heuristics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are bound to be very rough estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that in cases where there is a very significant disparity between the model's prediction and the bookie's offer following the model's pick is +EV.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model estimates ELO rating of the teams in a given league and takes into account all games already played in a given season.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then utilises a popular Monte Carlo method on the Author's supercomputer to run a number of simulations how the season's going to play out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get details on all games in the season via the API-FOOTBALL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Get ratings of the teams in the league from Opta Power Rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run a linear regression to translate the ratings from Opta into ELO ratings from clubelo.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simulate the season a number of times based on the ELO ratings obtained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare the model's predictions to the odds offered by the bookmaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole process is presented below. There are a couple of steps which require a small amount of manual labor, notably: scraping data from Opta, aligning the teams' names which differ across the data websites and checking the available odds and bets offered by the bookie."
